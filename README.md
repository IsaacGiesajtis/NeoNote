NeoNote is a smart note taking application that was my final year project in Uni with a group of 6 where I created the frontend and ai api for image to text and voice to text. 
A user can create an account and have their notes stored on the cloud. When creating a note we store everything in blocks which can be a text block, audio block or image block from here the user can move them around and modify the data.
I also made it so we can send the audio files to an api to convert the voice to text and also with the images the api will detect the text and put it into a text block.
